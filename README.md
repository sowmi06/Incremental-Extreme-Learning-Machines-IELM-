# Incremental-Extreme-Learning-Machines-IELM-
The repository has the code for which illustrates the IEML for the regression and classification problems.

- For the Classification problem the mnist dataset is taken from the keras.
- For the Regression problem the [qsar_fish_toxicity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+fish+toxicity) dataset is taken from the UCI repository.

## Tools and Library Requirements 
    
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)

- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) 
  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)

- [Keras](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/keras)

## Operating Instructions

The following are the steps to replicate the exact results acquired:

- Satisify all the system and the tool, libraries requirements.
- Clone the [Incremental Extreme Learning Machine](https://github.com/sowmi06/Incremental-Extreme-Learning-Machines-IELM-.git) repository in your local machine. 
- Run the [ielm_mnist.py](https://github.com/sowmi06/Incremental-Extreme-Learning-Machines-IELM-/blob/main/ielm_mnist.py) and [ielm_regression.py](https://github.com/sowmi06/Incremental-Extreme-Learning-Machines-IELM-/blob/main/ielm_regression.py) in a python IDE to get the final output
